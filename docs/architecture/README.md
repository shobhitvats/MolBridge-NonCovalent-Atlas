# MolBridge Architecture Suite

This directory decomposes and supersedes the monolithic `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` for users who prefer highly structured, navigable modules.

Index:
1. overview.md – Narrative system overview & context framing
2. data_model.md – Data representations, schemas, invariants
3. detectors.md – Detector taxonomy, per‑detector deep dives
4. feature_pipeline.md – Feature extraction stages and intermediate artifacts
5. performance_engine.md – Optimization catalogue, benchmarks, complexity & memory models
6. adaptive_thresholds.md – Heuristics, control theory analogies, tuning & stability
7. concurrency_and_parallelism.md – Process model, shared memory, scheduling
8. caching_and_persistence.md – Layered caching, invalidation, provenance coupling
9. normalization_and_provenance.md – Canonical forms, hashing strategies, reproducibility
10. api_and_ui_integration.md – FastAPI contract + Streamlit wiring
11. extensibility_guide.md – Formal extension contracts, cookbook patterns
12. testing_and_quality.md – Test matrix, coverage strategy, failure forensics
13. deployment_and_env.md – Environment profiles, flags, container topology
14. roadmap_and_decisions.md – Architectural decision records & future work

The unified technical document continues to exist for consolidated reading; these files allow deep, per‑topic exploration.
