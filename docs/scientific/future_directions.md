# Future Scientific Directions

## Planned Enhancements
| Feature | Scientific Benefit |
|---------|--------------------|
| Ligand-specific interaction enrichment | Characterize binding pocket selectivity |
| Cooperative motif detection (triads, ladders) | Reveal higher-order interaction networks |
| Energetic scoring layer (empirical potentials) | Approximate relative strengths |
| Metal coordination geometry classifier | Distinguish tetrahedral, octahedral, square planar |
| AltLoc occupancy weighting | More nuanced borderline classification |
| Solvent mediation tagging | Discriminate direct vs water-bridged interactions |
| Knowledge-based energy calibration | Link counts to approximate ΔΔG | Zhou & Zhou 2002 |
| Evolutionary conservation overlay | Prioritize functionally constrained interactions | AlphaFold & MSA-driven metrics |

## Research-Proximal Ideas
- Machine learning ranking of interaction criticality (feature importance over evolutionary conservation & interaction persistence across homologs).
- Time-resolved analysis integration for MD snapshots (trajectory reduction path).
 - Quantum mechanically derived parameter refinement for σ-hole direction vectors (higher fidelity axis estimation).
 - Integrative scoring combining interface SASA + interaction graph centrality.

## Community Contributions
Encourage domain experts to contribute refined criteria tables or element-specific parameter sets; provenance system will allow side-by-side comparisons.
Potential contribution checklist:
1. Provide dataset & justification.
2. Supply revised parameter table with referenced DOIs.
3. Include parity comparison vs baseline (false positive/negative analysis).
4. Submit reproducibility script enumerating exact run commands.
